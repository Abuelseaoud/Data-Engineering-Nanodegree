# Data Engineering Projects
All projects of Udacity's [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027). 

## Projects

### Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in json format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

### Project 2: Data Modeling with Cassandra
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will build a Data Model around our queries that we want to get answers for. 
For our use case we want below answers: 

 - Get details of a song that was herad on the music app history during a particular session. 
 - Get songs played by a user during particular session on music app. 
 - Get all users from the music app history who listened to a particular song.
